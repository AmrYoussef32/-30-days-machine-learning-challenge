# 30 Days of Machine Learning Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my 30 Days ML Challenge!

I am solving 3 machine learning projects daily to revise core concepts, improve my skills, and build a strong ML portfolio.  
Each day, I pick one project to polish and share here.

## 📅 Progress

| Day | Status | Highlight Project |
|----|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | ✅ | Linear Regression on California Housing |
| 2 | ✅ | Titanic Survival Prediction |
| 3 | 🕐 | Coming Soon |
| ... | ... | ... |
